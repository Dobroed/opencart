Copy all of this directly to your OpenCart root folder.

Prerequisites :
- proper .htaccess configuration (rename the .htaccess.txt file in the OpenCart archive to .htaccess if you have an Apache web server. If you have another type of server, see its documentation)
- "Use SEO URL's" set to yes in OpenCart System > Settings > Server tab

Go to your administration, module section, install it, then go to the edit page and generate your keywords. 

You'll have to generate the keywords everytime you add or update a category / product / manufacturer.
